# MSc-Thesis: Cost-aware Inverse Design for Materials with Properties on Demand

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my MSc thesis titled "Cost-aware Inverse Design for Materials with Properties on Demand." 
I am a graduate student specializing in Data Science, pursuing my Master of Science degree at the University of the Peloponnese and (NCSR) Demokritos.

This repository is dedicated to sharing the resources related to my thesis. 
I aim to continually update this repository with additional resources, including the code and implementation of the algorithms developed during my research.
